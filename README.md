# Handwritten-Text-Recognition
Train your model using K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm with having values of K as {2,4,5,6,7,10}, over data.csv file provided. The Train and Test split of the data should be in the ratio of 60:40, 70:30, 75:25, 80:20, 90:10, 95:5. Evaluate the performance of the model over test data for all these scenarios (36 cases), and submit the single jupyter notebook, having one of the scenario implemented (and rest in comments), and a single pdf file containing the results of all these scenarios (Accuracy, and Confusion Matrix), also your analysis regarding the dependency of the performance of model over training-testing split and k value.
